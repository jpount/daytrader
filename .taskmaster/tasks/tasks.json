The module contains 5 JAX-RS classes implementing an AddressBook demonstration API rather than actual trading functionality:\n\nAddressApplication.java - JAX-RS Application configuration class extending javax.ws.rs.core.Application, registers AddressBook.class as root resource and configures REST endpoint mapping\n\nAddressBook.java - Main JAX-RS resource with @Path(\"/addresses\"), implements full CRUD operations using GET/POST/PUT/DELETE methods, handles XML and form-encoded data via @Produces/@Consumes annotations, integrates with AddressBookDatabase for persistence, uses sub-resource locator pattern\n\nAddress.java - Dual-purpose class serving as both JAX-RS sub-resource and JAXB data model with @XmlRootElement annotation, contains address fields (entryName, zipCode, streetAddress, city, state, country), implements @GET method with content negotiation, includes full getter/setter methods and toString()\n\nAddressList.java - JAXB wrapper class for address collections with @XmlRootElement and @XmlElement annotations, contains LinkedList<Address> for XML serialization with simple getter method\n\nAddressBookDatabase.java - Static in-memory database simulation using HashMap<String, Address> storage, provides thread-safe methods (getAddress, storeAddress, getAddresses, removeAddress, clearEntries) for mock database operations\n\nTechnical analysis reveals this is demonstration code using JAX-RS 1.1 annotations, JAXB XML binding, in-memory storage without persistence, content negotiation for XML/form data, and sub-resource locator patterns.

TradeConfigServlet completely unprotected - database operations accessible to any user\n2. Data access methods trust userID parameters without ownership verification\n3. No separation between user and administrative operations\n4. Missing method-level security controls in EJB components\n5.

The assessment revealed one critical vulnerability in JSP parameter processing (quote.jsp symbols parameter) that allows direct user input inclusion in JSP includes, creating potential for SQL injection attacks via malformed symbol parameters. The application's dual-mode architecture shows that EJB mode operations are secure using parameterized @NamedQuery annotations, while Direct mode operations through TradeDirect class maintain security through consistent PreparedStatement usage with proper parameter binding. Medium-risk issues were identified in dynamic parameter setting and configuration parameter processing, though these are largely mitigated by parameterized query implementations. The root causes include lack of centralized input validation, direct JSP parameter usage, and absence of enterprise security frameworks like OWASP ESAPI. Overall assessment shows the application is generally well-protected against SQL injection due to proper PreparedStatement usage, with the primary attack vector being JSP-level parameter processing that requires immediate remediation.\n</info added on 2025-07-22T15:41:16.510Z>",

HIGH RISK - Reflected XSS in Registration Form (`register.jsp`)\n**Location:** `register.jsp:72-95`\n**Vulnerability Pattern:**\n```jsp\nString fullname =   request.getParameter(\"Full Name\");\nString snailmail=   request.getParameter(\"snail mail\");\nString email =      request.getParameter(\"email\");\nString userID =     request.getParameter(\"user id\");\nString money =      request.getParameter(\"money\");\n\n// Later directly output in HTML without encoding:\n<INPUT ... value=\"<%= fullname==null ? blank : fullname %>\">\n<INPUT ... value=\"<%= snailmail==null ? blank : snailmail %>\">\n<INPUT ... value=\"<%= email==null ? blank : email %>\">\n<INPUT ... value=\"<%= userID==null ? blank : userID %>\">\n<INPUT ... value='<%= money==null ? \"10000\" : money %>'>\n```\n**Impact:** Direct injection into HTML input value attributes\n**Attack Vector:** `GET /register.jsp?Full%20Name=\"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`\n**Risk Level:** CRITICAL - Direct parameter reflection\n\n### 2. HIGH RISK - Stored XSS via Results Messages\n**Locations:** Multiple JSP files display \"results\" attribute without encoding\n- `register.jsp:49`: `<%= results==null ? blank : results %>`\n- `account.jsp:120`: `<%=results%>`\n- `welcome.jsp:41`: `out.print(results)`\n- `config.jsp:55`: `out.print(status)`\n- `error.jsp:97-100`: `out.println` of error details\n\n**Vulnerability:** User-controlled error/status messages are reflected without HTML encoding\n**Attack Vector:** Malformed requests that generate error messages containing script tags\n**Impact:** Persistent XSS if error messages are stored\n\n### 3. MEDIUM RISK - Reflected XSS in Error Page (`error.jsp`)\n**Location:** `error.jsp:97-100`\n```jsp\nout.println(\"<br><br><b>Processing request:</b>\" +  url);      \nout.println(\"<br><b>StatusCode:</b> \" +  status_code);\nout.println(\"<br><b>Message:</b>\" + message);\nout.println(\"<br><b>Exception:</b>\" + exception_info);\n```\n**Vulnerability:** Request URI, error messages, and exception details output without encoding\n**Attack Vector:** Crafted URLs with script payloads in path or parameters\n**Impact:** Error page reflects malicious scripts\n\n### 4. MEDIUM RISK - Reflected XSS in Stock Symbol Processing\n**Location:** `quote.jsp:130-140`\n```jsp\nString symbols = request.getParameter(\"symbols\");\nwhile (st.hasMoreElements()) {\n    String symbol = st.nextToken();\n    String displayQuoteURL = \"displayQuote.jsp?symbol=\"+symbol;\n    <jsp:include page=\"<%=displayQuoteURL%>\"/>\n}\n```\n**Vulnerability:** While not directly output to HTML, symbols are passed to included JSPs\n**Risk:** Secondary XSS if displayQuote.jsp doesn't properly handle symbols\n\n## Additional XSS Attack Vectors:\n\n### 5. Account Profile Update Form (Stored XSS Risk)\n**Location:** `account.jsp:233-270`\n- Form fields for fullname, address, email display previous values from database\n- If malicious data is stored and later displayed, creates stored XSS\n**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (depends on data storage/retrieval sanitization)\n\n### 6. Configuration Parameter Display\n**Location:** `config.jsp` multiple locations\n- Configuration values potentially stored and redisplayed\n- Administrative interface with elevated privileges\n**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (administrative context increases impact)\n\n## XSS Prevention Analysis:\n\n### Current Protection Mechanisms:\n❌ **No HTML Encoding**: JSP files use raw `<%= %>` expressions\n❌ **No JSTL/ESAPI**: No secure output encoding libraries\n❌ **No Content Security Policy**: No CSP headers detected\n❌ **No XSS Filters**: No input sanitization on intake\n✅ **Session Management**: Proper session handling reduces some session hijacking risks\n\n### Encoding Issues Identified:\n1. **HTML Context**: User data directly embedded in HTML without encoding\n2. **Attribute Context**: User data in HTML attributes without proper escaping\n3. **JavaScript Context**: No JavaScript-specific encoding found (though limited JS usage)\n4. **URL Context**: Parameters passed to includes without URL encoding\n\n## Proof of Concept Attacks:\n\n### PoC 1: Registration Form XSS\n```\nGET /register.jsp?Full%20Name=\"><script>alert(document.cookie)</script><input%20type=\"hidden\n```\n\n### PoC 2: Symbol Parameter XSS\n```\nGET /app?action=quotes&symbols=\"><script>alert('XSS')</script>\n```\n\n### PoC 3: Error Page XSS\n```\nGET /<script>alert('XSS')</script>\n```\n\n## Impact Assessment:\n\n### High Impact Scenarios:\n1. **Session Hijacking**: Cookie theft via XSS in authenticated sections\n2. **Administrative Takeover**: XSS in config pages affecting admin users\n3. **Data Theft**: Script injection to exfiltrate sensitive trading data\n4. **CSRF Bypass**: XSS to perform unauthorized trading operations\n\n### Medium Impact Scenarios:\n1. **Phishing**: Overlay attacks on login/registration forms\n2. **UI Redressing**: Modify trading interface to mislead users\n3. **Information Disclosure**: Access to account balances and portfolio data\n\n## Root Cause Analysis:\n1. **Lack of Output Encoding**: No systematic HTML encoding of dynamic content\n2. **Legacy JSP Practices**: Direct scriptlet usage instead of secure tag libraries\n3. **No Security Framework**: Missing OWASP ESAPI or similar protection\n4. **No Input Validation**: Parameters accepted without sanitization\n5. **Missing Security Headers**: No XSS protection via HTTP headers\n\n## Severity Summary:\n- **Critical Issues**: 1 (Direct parameter reflection in registration)\n- **High Risk Issues**: 1 (Results message display)\n- **Medium Risk Issues**: 4 (Error pages, symbol processing, stored XSS potential)\n- **Total XSS Vectors**: 15+ distinct injection points across JSP files\n\nThe application is highly vulnerable to XSS attacks due to systematic lack of output encoding and extensive use of user-controlled data in JSP expressions.\n</info added on 2025-07-22T15:42:49.614Z>",
