# Product Requirements Document: Comprehensive Codebase Documentation System

## Overview
Create a comprehensive documentation system for large-scale legacy codebase analysis and migration planning, using DayTrader3 as the initial test case.

## Objectives
1. **Complete Code Understanding**: Document every component, relationship, and business flow
2. **Migration Readiness**: Generate actionable migration plans from legacy to modern stacks
3. **Scalable Process**: Establish repeatable methodology for codebases of any size
4. **Visual Documentation**: Create architectural diagrams and flow charts
5. **Team Coordination**: Enable multiple developers to work on documentation simultaneously

## Scope
- Analyze Java EE applications (extensible to other stacks)
- Document web tier, business logic, data models, and integrations
- Generate migration plans to Spring Boot + Angular
- Create visual architecture and sequence diagrams
- Establish quality gates and completeness criteria

## User Stories

### US1: Component Discovery
**As a** technical architect  
**I want** a complete inventory of all application components  
**So that** I can understand the system's structure and plan migration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All servlets, EJBs, entities, JSPs documented with metadata
- Component relationships mapped and visualized
- Technology stack and framework usage identified
- Performance characteristics noted

### US2: Business Logic Extraction
**As a** business analyst  
**I want** detailed documentation of all business workflows  
**So that** I can ensure business logic is preserved during migration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Complete flow documentation from UI to database
- Business rules extracted and cataloged
- Transaction boundaries identified
- Error handling patterns documented

### US3: API Documentation
**As a** frontend developer  
**I want** comprehensive API documentation  
**So that** I can build equivalent REST APIs for the new system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All endpoints documented with request/response formats
- Authentication and authorization requirements identified
- Session management patterns documented
- Error response formats cataloged

### US4: Data Model Analysis
**As a** database architect  
**I want** complete data model documentation  
**So that** I can design the target database schema

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Entity relationship diagrams created
- All JPA mappings documented
- Database constraints and indexes identified
- Data migration strategy outlined

### US5: Migration Planning
**As a** development manager  
**I want** detailed migration plans and effort estimates  
**So that** I can plan the modernization project

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Component-by-component migration mapping
- Risk assessment for each migration step
- Effort estimates and dependencies identified
- Modern architecture design documented

### US6: Quality Assurance
**As a** quality engineer  
**I want** validation that documentation is complete and accurate  
**So that** the migration can proceed with confidence

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Documentation completeness metrics
- Cross-reference validation
- Code-to-docs traceability
- Review and approval workflows

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Handle codebases up to 100,000 files
- Generate documentation in under 2 hours for medium projects
- Support incremental updates for code changes

### Scalability
- Multiple team members can work simultaneously
- Support for distributed analysis across modules
- Conflict resolution for concurrent documentation

### Quality
- 100% component coverage
- Automated validation of relationships
- Version control integration
- Review and approval processes

### Output Formats
- Markdown for human-readable docs
- Mermaid diagrams for visual representation
- JSON/YAML for machine-readable metadata
- PDF reports for stakeholder communication

## Deliverables

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
1. **Component Discovery System**
   - Automated code scanning
   - Component metadata extraction
   - Initial relationship mapping

2. **Documentation Templates**
   - Standardized component documentation format
   - Business flow documentation template
   - API documentation template

### Phase 2: Deep Analysis (Week 2-3)
1. **Business Logic Extraction**
   - Complete workflow documentation
   - Business rules catalog
   - Transaction analysis

2. **API and Integration Analysis**
   - Endpoint documentation
   - Message flow analysis
   - External dependency mapping

### Phase 3: Migration Planning (Week 4)
1. **Target Architecture Design**
   - Modern stack component mapping
   - Migration strategy documentation
   - Risk assessment and mitigation

2. **Visual Documentation**
   - Architectural diagrams
   - Sequence diagrams
   - Data flow diagrams

### Phase 4: Validation and Delivery (Week 5)
1. **Quality Assurance**
   - Completeness validation
   - Accuracy verification
   - Stakeholder review

2. **Final Deliverables**
   - Complete documentation package
   - Migration roadmap
   - Effort estimates and timeline

## Success Criteria
- 100% component coverage documented
- All major business flows mapped
- Complete migration plan with <10% estimate variance
- Stakeholder approval on documentation quality
- Successful pilot migration of 1-2 components

## Assumptions and Constraints
- Access to complete source code
- Ability to run the application for validation
- Technical SMEs available for business logic validation
- Modern target stack decision already made

## Risks and Mitigation
1. **Incomplete Documentation**: Implement automated validation
2. **Business Logic Misunderstanding**: Regular SME reviews
3. **Migration Complexity Underestimated**: Conservative estimates with buffers
4. **Tool Limitations**: Fallback to manual analysis for complex cases

## Definition of Done
- All components documented with required metadata
- Business flows validated by SMEs
- Migration plans reviewed and approved
- Documentation maintained in version control
- Knowledge transfer completed to development teams
