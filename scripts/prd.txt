# DayTrader3 Documentation Project - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the comprehensive documentation initiative for the DayTrader3 trading application. The project aims to create detailed technical documentation, architectural diagrams, and assessment reports across four specialized domains: architecture, technical implementation, security, and performance. This documentation will serve as the definitive reference for understanding, maintaining, and enhancing the DayTrader3 application.

## 2. Product overview

DayTrader3 is a trading application that requires comprehensive documentation to support ongoing development, maintenance, and security compliance. The documentation project encompasses analysis of the existing codebase located in the `./app` directory and production of structured technical documentation across multiple domains. This initiative will produce four primary deliverables: architectural documentation with Mermaid.js diagrams, technical class documentation, security assessment, and performance evaluation.
